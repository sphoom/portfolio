#  Insurance Charges Prediction & Analysis

This project explores how data-driven insights can support an insurance provider in understanding and managing insurance charges more effectively. The work focuses on three strategic objectives:

###  Project Goals

- **Predictive Pricing**  
  Can we accurately predict how much a customer will be charged using statistical and machine learning models?

- **Risk Assessment**  
  Which factors (e.g., age, BMI, smoking status) most significantly impact insurance costs?

- **Customer Segmentation**  
  Can we identify distinct customer groups to enable more targeted pricing strategies and personalized marketing?
