**Insurance Charges Prediction and Anakysis**  
This project aims to help an insurance provider better understand the drivers of insurance costs and identify strategic opportunities in three key areas:

Predictive Pricing: Can we accurately predict how much a customer will be charged?  

Risk Assessment: Which factors most significantly influence insurance costs?  

Customer Segmentation: Can we identify distinct customer groups for targeted pricing and marketing?
